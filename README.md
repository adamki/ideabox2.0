# IdeaBox2.0

### Not your basic CRUD app! 

##### What?
Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say "the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them." In this project, we'll be building a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas (good and bad alike).

##### How?  -  Tech Stack
Throughout the project, one of my focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we'll rely on JavaScript and jQuery to implement snappy filtering in the browser, and AJAX to enable inconspicuous communication between client and server.



* Architecture

I will be treating the Client and Server as two seperate entities. To do this: 

A Rails application to manage data related to our ideas and serve initial UI templates (or just public/index.html)
JavaScript (with jQuery) to manage client-side interactions and communicate asynchronously with the server
In order to get more experience doing DOM manipulations and AJAX event handling on our own, we will not be using client-side frameworks (Ember, Angular, React, etc.).

Your entire application will consist of one HTML page or template. You will not have separate pages for each CRUD action.

All of your AJAX functionality will be triggered by jQuery.
