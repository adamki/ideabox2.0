# IdeaBox2.0

### Not your basic CRUD app! 

##### What?
Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say "the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them." In this project, we'll be building a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas (good and bad alike).

##### How?  -  Tech Stack
Throughout the project, one of my focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we'll rely on JavaScript and jQuery to implement snappy filtering in the browser, and AJAX to enable inconspicuous communication between client and server.

**Architecture and Goals**

I will be treating the Client and Server as two seperate entities.

* A Rails application to manage data related to our ideas and serve initial UI templates.
* JavaScript (with jQuery) to manage client-side interactions and communicate asynchronously with the server.
* In order to get more experience doing DOM manipulations and AJAX event handling on our own, I will not be using client-side frameworks (Ember, Angular, React, etc.)...
* The entire application will consist of one HTML page or template. You will not have separate pages for each CRUD action.
* All of your AJAX functionality will be triggered by jQuery.
